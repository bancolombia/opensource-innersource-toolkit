# README template

## Mission

This should contain a brief description (3-5 sentences) of your project's mission. The goal is to indicate what you plan to work on and to help external contributors understand approximately what types of features will be welcome for this project.

## How to start?

This section should contain short documentation written for first-time users on how to get started with the project. More detailed documentation can be linked from here.

## Additional Information
This section may list the following items:

- A list of features, use cases that the software addresses.
- Information on the design principles that are used to solve the offsets
- Links to more user-level documentation
- Answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), preferably in a format that allows you to link specific questions and their answers for easier reference.

## How do I get help?

This section should contain a short documentation on how to get help for the project as a user. This could be as simple as directing users to the issue tracker if this is how your project would like to answer questions. It could also point to an archived and searchable chat channel, some archived and searchable mailing list, some online user forum.
Involved
This section should include information on how to contact the project: typically this will contain links to archived, searchable and linkable communication channels.
About us
This is a good place to give credit to the Trusted Committers of the project.
It's also a good place to include information about what being a Trusted Committer means for this project, although ideally all projects in an organization use the same definition that you only link to from here. The reason for keeping the link here is so that colleagues who have little or no experience working and contributing to InnerSource projects have a direct link to company-wide information on the technology projects they need for their daily work.

## How to contribute?

This section should document (or link to documentation) all the things a first-time taxpayer needs to know to get started. Generally, not all topics will be covered below. Focus on what your project differs from the standard setup and what previous contributors found difficult to understand.
- Find the source code.
- Find a list of problems your project needs help with; these can be technical and non-technical issues. Typically, you'll keep them on an issue tracker accessible to collaborators.
- Links to additional documentation, for example, about the project architecture, general coding conventions, testing conventions...
- For technical contributions: Make changes, build the project and test your changes.
- Sending your changes to the project.
  
Ideally, also include information about what the preferred process for changes looks like for the project: Should contributors first open an issue and submit a proposal, or are they welcome to submit changes right away? What is important to you when reviewing contributions?
In addition, you must describe the design values ​​that you want to follow in the project. Making them explicit often helps resolve trade-offs faster and easier. In addition, it helps make changes to implicit assumptions transparent.
Over time you will notice that this section grows substantially. In that case, consider moving the information to separate files, for example, CONTRIBUTING.md and TESTING.md.
